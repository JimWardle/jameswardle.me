      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a DevOps Engineer with more than 15 years of experience in IT, now focused on automation, Azure, and platform engineering. My day-to-day work is about making deployments faster, infrastructure more reliable, and teams more productive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve led the move to scalable infrastructure using Azure VM Scale Sets, built automated pipelines that eliminate repetitive tasks, and mentored engineers while documenting and improving internal processes. I work best when I’m close to the code, helping developers ship better software, and simplifying complexity without cutting corners.
      </p>
      <p>
        My background includes time as a software engineer, educator, and systems technician — and that blend shows in how I work: pragmatic, structured, and good at explaining tricky things clearly. I’ve worked across public and private sectors, from universities to SaaS platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your team values clean automation, solid engineering, and a bias toward action, we’ll probably get on well.
