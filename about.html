      <h1>About Me</h1>
      
      <p>I'm James, a DevOps Engineer based in the West Midlands. I help teams work more efficiently by automating repetitive tasks and creating documentation that people actually want to follow.</p>

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>My approach is straightforward: calm, patient, and never patronising. When I'm explaining something technical, I prefer to show rather than tell. I'll create an environment where you feel confident to try things yourself, with just enough scaffolding to support you along the way.</p>
      
      <p>What drives me is turning problems into solutions. Whether that's:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Streamlining those repetitive tasks that eat up everyone's time</li>
        <li>Writing documentation that's actually useful (not just comprehensive)</li>
        <li>Turning a rough idea into a working product over a weekend</li>
        <li>Helping teams ship more reliably with less stress</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>I didn't take a straight path to DevOps. I studied Communication and Media, spent some time teaching (which was stressful but taught me patience), and gradually found my way into infrastructure and automation.</p>
      
      <p>The teaching experience, whilst challenging, gave me skills that serve me well now:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Breaking complex problems into manageable steps</li>
        <li>Creating explanations that actually make sense</li>
        <li>Staying calm when everything's on fire</li>
        <li>Building confidence in others to try new approaches</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I'm Like</h2>
      <p>I tend to collect and cycle through hobbies, diving deep into something before parking it and moving on to the next interesting thing. Current and recurring interests include:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Board games</strong> – Strategy over luck, every time</li>
        <li><strong>3D printing</strong> – Usually printing solutions to problems I didn't know I had</li>
        <li><strong>Tech tinkering</strong> – Modding old consoles, Raspberry Pi projects, home automation</li>
        <li><strong>Cooking and baking bread</strong> – There's something satisfying about processes that work consistently</li>
        <li><strong>Cycling and running</strong> – Helps me think through problems</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My colleagues would probably tell you I have a habit of wandering off topic when discussing things (which I'd argue is just exploring interesting tangents).</p>

      <h2>Personal Life</h2>
      <p>I live with my wife, who's the Director of Operations at a cancer support charity. She's driven, funny, and has a bright personality that keeps me motivated and pushes me to stretch myself. She also gives excellent feedback on websites, as you can probably tell from this one.</p>

      <p>Together we've worked on various side projects, and there's something amazing about turning the breadcrumb of an idea into a tangible site or product that actually works.</p>

      <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> I'm someone who enjoys solving problems, explaining things clearly, and helping teams work better together. If you value calm problem-solving and practical solutions over flashy tech for its own sake, we'll probably get along well.</p>
