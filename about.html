      <h1>About Me</h1>
      
      <p>I'm James, a DevOps Engineer based in the West Midlands with an unusual background that makes me good at what I do.</p>

      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>I didn't start in tech. I studied Communication and Media at Coventry University, then spent 5 years teaching ICT and Computing to teenagers. Teaching 15-year-olds about databases and programming taught me:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>How to explain complex things simply</strong> – If you can make a reluctant Year 10 understand SQL joins, you can help any developer understand your deployment process</li>
        <li><strong>Patience and persistence</strong> – Some problems need multiple approaches before they click</li>
        <li><strong>How to document things properly</strong> – Because if you don't, you'll be answering the same questions forever</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
      <p>I genuinely enjoy solving problems that make other people's work easier. Whether that's:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Automating manual deployments so developers can focus on building features</li>
        <li>Setting up monitoring that actually helps rather than just creating noise</li>
        <li>Writing runbooks that new team members can actually follow</li>
        <li>Building tools that save hours of tedious work</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>My teaching background shows up in how I approach DevOps:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I explain things clearly</strong> – No jargon, no assumptions about what people already know</li>
        <li><strong>I document as I go</strong> – Future me (and future colleagues) will thank present me</li>
        <li><strong>I break complex problems down</strong> – Big scary infrastructure changes become manageable steps</li>
        <li><strong>I'm not precious about my solutions</strong> – If there's a better way, let's do that instead</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
      <p>I live in the West Midlands with my wife (who keeps me grounded and gives excellent website feedback). When I'm not automating deployments, I'm usually:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Building side projects that solve real problems I actually have</li>
        <li>Learning new tech by building something useful with it</li>
        <li>Playing board games that require more strategy than luck</li>
        <li>Trying to convince people that pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> I'm someone who makes technical teams more effective by combining solid engineering skills with the ability to communicate clearly and help others succeed.</p>
