      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>I'm James, a DevOps Engineer based in the West Midlands. I help teams work more efficiently by automating repetitive tasks and writing documentation that people actually use.</p>

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>My approach is calm, methodical, and grounded in real experience. I prefer to show rather than tell, and I aim to create an environment where people feel confident to explore and learn — with just enough structure to support them.</p>

      <p>What motivates me is solving practical problems, whether that's:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automating those daily tasks that quietly waste hours</li>
        <li>Writing documentation that's clear, to the point, and frequently referenced</li>
        <li>Turning a weekend idea into a working tool</li>
        <li>Helping teams release software with less friction</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>Like many in DevOps, I didn’t follow a straight line. I studied Communication and Media, spent a few years teaching (which was demanding but formative), and gradually shifted toward infrastructure, scripting, and cloud automation.</p>

      <p>That teaching experience gave me a solid base in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Breaking down complex problems into manageable parts</li>
        <li>Communicating clearly with different audiences</li>
        <li>Staying focused when multiple things are going wrong</li>
        <li>Helping others build confidence in unfamiliar territory</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I'm Like</h2>
      <p>I tend to deep-dive into interests before moving on to the next challenge. It keeps things interesting. Current and recurring themes include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Board games</strong> – Prefer strategy to chance</li>
        <li><strong>3D printing</strong> – Often fixing problems I didn’t realise needed fixing</li>
        <li><strong>Tech tinkering</strong> – Raspberry Pi setups, retro consoles, automation projects</li>
        <li><strong>Baking bread</strong> – Like good code, it's about getting the process right</li>
        <li><strong>Cycling and running</strong> – Useful time for problem solving, too</li>
      </ul>

      <p>People say I have a tendency to go off on tangents when discussing problems — I think of it as exploring the space thoroughly.</p>

      <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> I like solving problems, explaining things clearly, and helping teams work smarter. If you prefer steady, practical progress over flashy promises, we’ll probably get along.</p>
