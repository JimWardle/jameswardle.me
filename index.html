      <h1>Hi, I'm James</h1>
      <p class="tagline">DevOps Engineer · West Midlands · Problem Solver</p>
      <p>
        I help development teams work more efficiently by automating the repetitive stuff and creating documentation that people actually want to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        I take a calm, patient approach to solving problems. Whether it's streamlining deployments, fixing poor documentation, or turning a weekend idea into a working product, I enjoy making things work better.

      <h2>Recent Project: Leaf Spy Analyzer</h2>
      <p>
        I built a web app that turns smartphone videos of EV diagnostic screens into professional battery reports. What used to require expensive specialist equipment now takes 20 seconds and costs £3.99.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built with Next.js, FFmpeg, and GPT-4o for the OCR processing. The whole thing went from idea to working product in under 20 hours, which is exactly the kind of rapid problem-solving I enjoy.
