      <h2>DevOps Engineer – Mercury</h2>
      <p>
        I joined Mercury to help improve how we deploy and manage software across a multi-tenant Azure environment. I led the move to Azure VM Scale Sets for more reliable and scalable releases, replacing hosted build agents with customised VMSS-based ones to gain full control over tooling.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my biggest contributions has been automating Dynamics environment updates and client offboarding processes — removing manual steps, reducing risk, and saving time. I work closely with developers in daily stand-ups, mentor junior engineers, and keep documentation sharp and useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tools and areas of focus: PowerShell, Azure DevOps, YAML pipelines, Microsoft Dynamics, SQL/Cosmos DB, Datadog, and blob storage. The team runs on a two-week release cycle, and I often lead the release process end to end.
      </p>
    
      <h2>DevOps Engineer – Coventry University</h2>
      <p>
        Over four years at Coventry, I looked after Azure DevOps pipelines, Jenkins infrastructure, and CI/CD workflows across multiple teams. I supported API platforms like MuleSoft, administered cloud services, and handled release processes for both internal and vendor-supported systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside the technical work, I also supported developers with Git workflows, managed SQL and PL/SQL queries, and kept legacy systems running during a slow transition to modern tooling.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Earlier Roles</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve also worked as a software engineer, ICT teacher, and infrastructure technician — experiences that shaped how I communicate, support others, and solve problems. Highlights include migrating lecture platforms to the cloud ahead of schedule, designing internal tools for schools, and delivering digital training for staff and students alike.
