      <h1>Experience</h1>
    
      <h2>DevOps Engineer – Mercury (2023-Present)</h2>
      <p><strong>What I do:</strong> Make deployments faster and more reliable for a multi-tenant Azure SaaS platform.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Key achievements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eliminated deployment bottlenecks</strong> – Moved from hosted build agents to custom Azure VM Scale Sets, giving us full control over tooling and reducing build times</li>
        <li><strong>Automated manual processes</strong> – Built PowerShell automation for Dynamics environment updates and client offboarding, removing 2-3 hours of manual work per task</li>
        <li><strong>Improved team productivity</strong> – Lead release processes end-to-end, mentor junior engineers, and keep documentation actually useful</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced deployment risk</strong> – Standardized our two-week release cycle with proper rollback procedures and monitoring</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>How my teaching background helps:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>I explain complex deployment processes in plain English during stand-ups</li>
        <li>My documentation is written so new team members can actually follow it</li>
        <li>I break down scary infrastructure changes into manageable steps</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Daily tools:</strong> PowerShell, Azure DevOps, YAML pipelines, Microsoft Dynamics, SQL/Cosmos DB, Datadog, Azure Storage</p>
    
      <h2>DevOps Engineer – Coventry University (2020-2023)</h2>
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Managed CI/CD for multiple development teams across a large university IT department.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Key achievements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Modernized legacy systems</strong> – Gradually moved teams from manual deployments to proper CI/CD pipelines</li>
        <li><strong>Supported diverse platforms</strong> – Everything from APIs (MuleSoft) to databases (SQL/Oracle) to third-party integrations</li>
        <li><strong>Improved developer experience</strong> – Helped teams adopt Git workflows and proper branching strategies</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced deployment stress</strong> – Implemented automated testing and deployment processes that actually worked</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> How to work with teams that have very different technical needs, and how to gradually introduce change without breaking everything.</p>

      <h2>Software Engineer – Coventry University (2019-2020)</h2>
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Application development and support, plus managing legacy VB6 systems that somehow still needed to work.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Key achievements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kept legacy systems running</strong> – Maintained VB6 applications while planning their eventual replacement</li>
        <li><strong>Improved deployment processes</strong> – Used Visual Studio, Jenkins, and proper version control (SVN at the time)</li>
        <li><strong>Supported third-party systems</strong> – Worked with vendors on Pure, Tableau, and other enterprise software</li>
        <li><strong>Created training materials</strong> – Documented processes so other developers could maintain the systems</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Teaching Career (2014-2017)</h2>
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Taught ICT and Computing to 11-18 year olds across multiple schools.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Skills that transfer to DevOps:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Explaining complex concepts simply</strong> – If you can teach databases to reluctant teenagers, you can explain deployment pipelines to anyone</li>
        <li><strong>Creating clear documentation</strong> – Lesson plans, marking schemes, and student guides taught me to write instructions people actually follow</li>
        <li><strong>Managing multiple projects</strong> – Tracking progress of 150+ students across different year groups and ability levels</li>
        <li><strong>Staying calm under pressure</strong> – Ever tried to debug Python with 30 fifteen-year-olds asking for help simultaneously?</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous improvement</strong> – Constantly adapting teaching methods based on what worked and what didn't</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Notable achievements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set up and managed Duke of Edinburgh Award schemes</li>
        <li>Delivered school-wide ICT training for teaching staff</li>
        <li>Achieved qualified teacher status and consistently good student outcomes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Early Technical Roles (2007-2014)</h2>
      <p><strong>Where it all started:</strong> Various ICT technician and network admin roles that taught me the fundamentals.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What I learned:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to troubleshoot under pressure (usually with a room full of frustrated users)</li>
        <li>The importance of proper documentation and change management</li>
        <li>How to work with both technical and non-technical stakeholders</li>
        <li>That automation beats manual processes every time</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Built wireless networks, managed server infrastructure, created automated systems for ID cards and asset management using QR codes (this was pretty cutting-edge in 2012!).</p>
