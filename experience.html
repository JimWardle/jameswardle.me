      <h1>Experience</h1>
    
      <h2>DevOps Engineer – Mercury (2023-Present)</h2>
      <p>I work on deployment automation and infrastructure for a multi-tenant Azure SaaS platform. Day-to-day, this means making sure releases go smoothly and helping developers when things don't work as expected.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What I've been working on:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Moved us from hosted build agents to Azure VM Scale Sets, which gave us much more control over the build environment</li>
        <li>Automated Dynamics environment updates and client offboarding processes using PowerShell - saved a lot of manual work</li>
        <li>Lead our two-week release cycles and help out with mentoring junior engineers</li>
        <li>Improved our documentation so it's actually useful rather than just comprehensive</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Tools I use regularly:</strong> PowerShell, Azure DevOps, YAML pipelines, Microsoft Dynamics, SQL/Cosmos DB, Datadog, Azure Storage</p>

      <p>Recent feedback from my performance review was positive enough to get the highest pay rise they could give me, which was nice.</p>
    
      <h2>DevOps Engineer – Coventry University (2020-2023)</h2>
      <p>Managed CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure for multiple development teams across the university. This was a mix of legacy systems and newer cloud-based stuff.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What I worked on:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintained Azure DevOps pipelines, Jenkins infrastructure, and various API platforms like MuleSoft</li>
        <li>Helped teams move from manual deployments to proper automated processes (gradually - you can't change everything at once)</li>
        <li>Supported third-party systems like Pure and Tableau alongside our internal development work</li>
        <li>Worked with both SQL and Oracle databases, writing queries and troubleshooting when things broke</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The university environment taught me how to work with teams that have very different technical needs and comfort levels with change.</p>

      <h2>Software Engineer – Coventry University (2019-2020)</h2>
      <p>Application development and support, including some legacy VB6 systems that somehow still needed to work properly.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Main responsibilities:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintained and deployed applications using Visual Studio, Jenkins, and SVN (this was before we moved to Git)</li>
        <li>Worked with external vendors on system upgrades and troubleshooting</li>
        <li>Created training materials and documentation for other developers</li>
        <li>Kept those VB6 applications running while we planned their eventual replacement</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Teaching Roles (2014-2017)</h2>
      <p>I taught ICT and Computing to 11-18 year olds across several schools. This was a stressful period, but it taught me valuable skills that I use every day now.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What transfers to my current work:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Breaking complex problems into manageable steps</li>
        <li>Explaining technical concepts without using jargon</li>
        <li>Creating documentation that people can actually follow</li>
        <li>Staying calm when multiple things are going wrong at once</li>
        <li>Building confidence in others to try new approaches</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I also set up Duke of Edinburgh Award schemes and delivered ICT training for teaching staff, which involved a lot of project management and working with people who had very different technical comfort levels.</p>

      <h2>Early Technical Roles (2007-2014)</h2>
      <p>Various ICT technician and network administrator positions where I learned the fundamentals of infrastructure and support.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Key things I learned:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to troubleshoot problems under pressure (usually with frustrated users waiting)</li>
        <li>The importance of proper documentation and change management</li>
        <li>How to work with both technical teams and end users</li>
        <li>That automation almost always beats doing things manually</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Notable projects included building wireless networks, managing server infrastructure, and creating automated systems for things like ID card printing and asset management using QR codes.</p>
