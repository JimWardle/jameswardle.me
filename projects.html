        <h2>SuperCrumble – Crypto Portfolio Analytics</h2>
        <p>
          Built in 48 hours as a performance challenge, SuperCrumble reduced crypto portfolio analysis times from minutes to under a second. Powered by PHP, MySQL, and GitHub Actions, it was designed for speed, accuracy, and ease of deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a solo sprint from concept to delivery, with a focus on minimal latency, clean UX, and automating routine data handling tasks.

        <h2>DiceDecider.com – Game Night Helper</h2>
        <p>
          A fast, lightweight tool for indecisive board game groups. Pulls live data from the BoardGameGeek API to recommend games based on player count, play time, and mood. Built for fun, but coded cleanly and deployed with care.

        <h2>Peg It – Weather-Based Laundry Advisor</h2>
        <p>
          A simple tool built in one afternoon to help decide whether it’s worth hanging washing out. It interprets weather data into plain advice — sunny, safe, or sack it off. A fun side project grounded in real-life usefulness.
        </p>

        <h2>DevOps Improvements (Work Projects)</h2>
        <p>
          Various internal improvements across CI/CD, infrastructure, and release processes — including automation of multi-step deployments, environment scaling, and process simplification. These projects are commercial or confidential, but they reflect day-to-day impact in my current roles.

        <h2>Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Always learning — recently focused on Terraform, Docker, and cross-platform DevOps practices. Most experiments stay private, but I document the thinking and code where I can.
