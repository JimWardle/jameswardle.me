          <li>Progress saving and restoration — export your state as markdown to resume later</li>
          <li>Collapsible sections and sticky controls for focus during operational work</li>
          <li>Local-only processing for complete privacy with sensitive information</li>

          <li>PowerShell automation scanning 17,000+ flows with Git-based deployment</li>
          <li>React dashboard with real-time filtering and data export functionality</li>
          <li>Azure Static Web Apps hosting with CI/CD and global distribution</li>

        <h2>Other Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SuperCrumble:</strong> Educational crypto portfolio tracker that survived the 2025 market turbulence. Built with PHP/MySQL and Python analysis scripts — reduced query times from minutes to sub-second with smart caching. Currently paused whilst optimising GitHub Actions usage.</li>
          <li><strong>DiceDecider:</strong> Board game recommendation tool that pulls live data from BoardGameGeek to suggest games based on player count and mood. Built because choosing what to play shouldn't take longer than actually playing.</li>
          <li><strong>Peg It (WashingLine):</strong> Weather-driven laundry advisor that turns forecast data into plain-language drying advice. Built in one afternoon to solve the eternal question of whether it's worth hanging washing out.</li>
          <li><strong>DevOps Improvements:</strong> Internal tooling and automation projects including CI/CD pipeline optimisation, environment scaling, and deployment streamlining across various platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning Projects:</strong> Ongoing experiments with Terraform, Docker, and cross-platform DevOps patterns. Usually built to solve specific problems I've encountered rather than academic learning.</li>
        </ul>
